			<h1>History of Bacarra<br></h1>
			<p>The original inhabitants of the area that was become the present day municipality of Bacarra was a sturdy and industrious race and predominantly Malays. They immigrated to the Philippines in two waves. The second wave being from the first century AD and continuing throughout the 13th century AD. It is from these immigrates of this wave that the present day residents of Bacarra are descended.</p>



			<p>Spaniards found that the inhabitants of the area had a distinctive character and culture such different from their fellow countrymen in the south – with different dialects although belonging to the mother tongue Tagalog, it had a different idiosyncrasies making the Ilocano dialect quite different from the Tagalog.</p>
		


			<p>The name Bacarra has two legendary origins. One legend tells of a native fisherman who was out fishing in what is now known as the Bacarra River . Two Spanish soldiers promenading the place had asked the fisherman about the name of the place. Not understanding what the soldier meant, jubilantly answered “Bacbacarra, Señor”. The Spanish went away with the thought that Bacarra was the name of the place.</p>
		


			<p>Another related story was the coining of a by-word of a farmer and his wife who were making big basket called “Bakar” which was used as rice basket. From these two legends, the Spaniards associated it with the town into its present name which is “BACARRA”, the same place where most of the Bacarreños now live.</p>
